We’d love to accept your patches and contributions! 
For details, please check the `README.md` and `docs/contributing.md` 
files in the repository of the project that you’re interested in.

Please get in touch if you’re interested in starting a new project
or moving an existing repository to this organization! All projects
hosted here need to have good test coverage. We’re happy to help
you with setting up unit and integration tests, but we rely on your
contributions for continued maintenance.

Also, see the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
