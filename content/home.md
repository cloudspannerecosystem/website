The Cloud Spanner Ecosystem [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem)
organization hosts a collection of public
repositories that are owned-by and
developed-for the [Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner)
user community.

All the hosted projects are based on open source contributions.
We’d love for you to report issues, file feature requests,
and send pull requests (see [contributions](/contributing)).
Note that none of the projects are officially supported by Google
as part of the Cloud Spanner product.

Please [let us know](https://gitter.im/cloudspannerecosystem/community)
if you’re interested in getting your project hosted! This will help other
Cloud Spanner developers find your project and contribute to it.

* [Projects](/projects) describes all the hosted repositories.
* [Resources](/resources) is a collection of Cloud Spanner related content:
  blog posts, meetups, talks, tools, guides, etc.
